### Learning VHDL (programming language)

I know very little about the VHDL language. This document will go over all my knowledge of the VHDL language.

#### Comments in VHDL

This is how you make comments in VHDL:

```vhdl
-- this is a single line VHDL comment
/*
    this is a block comment (in VHDL-2008 and later)
*/
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of VHDL

1. VHDL stands for **V**irtual **H**ardware **D**escription **L**anguage

2. VHDL is a hardware description language, and can work as a language to writing an operating system

3. VHDL is used in creating virtual machine hard drive files

4. VHDL uses the `*.vhd` and `*.vhdl` file extensions

5. No other knowledge of the VHDL programming language
